                    </div>
                    <p>I live near the center of Charlotte in North Carolina, however I hope to move back to the West coast eventually, 
                        either up in Washington near family, or Southern California in the area I lived before!</p>
                    <p>I originally studied Computer Science in college, and have always had an interest in coding and development. This 
                        portfolio website is to help show my projects and more information about myself, for anybody interested in either
                        contacting or hiring me.</p>
