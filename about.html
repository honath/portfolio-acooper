                <h2>About me</h2>
                <div>
                    <p>I've had an interest in coding for most of my life, and am working towards a degree in
                        Computer Science.</p>
                    <p>One thing I've always enjoyed about coding has been the problem solving involved in it - always 
                        having a new task or problem, and being able to come up with a solution, whether it be a tried-and-true 
                        resolution or a brand new, unique answer, has always been exciting to me. I love being faced with new challenges 
                        and needing to figure out ways to overcome them on a daily basis.</p>
                    <p>Another aspect of coding that I am particularly fond of is the ability to create, whether it be a new software, a level
                        in a game, or a website, creating has always been a part of my life, and I look forward to working on a team to
                        create new and exciting things.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>My interestes and hobbies outside of programming also tend to include creativity in creation, and problem solving
                        in the form of implementing my idea, or overcoming limitations, such as specialty tools.</p>
                    <p>A great example is my woodworking - something as simple as the necklace above took some creativity, as I lacked 
                        many of the tools that would have made carving it easy. My other "crafting" hobby is blacksmithing - as for the 
                        less crafty ones, I'm interested in things like hiking, kayaking, and climbing, and I enjoy playing video 
                        games and watching anime.</p>
                    <p>If you would like to contact me for any reason, such as for work or otherwise, all of my information is available
